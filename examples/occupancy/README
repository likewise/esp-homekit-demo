Demo of a HomeKit occupancy sensor
Leon 'likewise' Woestenberg <leon@sidebranch.com>

using two available boards:

1. Sonoff (RF) R2 Power v1.0 (with ESP8285)
2. Elecrow Crowtail Mini PIR Motion Sensor v2.0

The Sonoff board is labeled "Sonoff RF R2 Power V1.0." on the PCB.
However this project uses the version without the RF add-on-board.

This project further features/supports the following:
Over-the-Air firmware updates, using Life-Cycle-Manager (LCM), which
in turn depends on rboot.

And as a result, assuming the Sonoff is not connected with wires,
printf() or any standard output is redirected to UDP payloads
across WiFi, and can be picked up with tcpdump on a host system.
(Or a simple UDP client.) Use "make monitor" for tcpdump.

The Sonoff must first be programmed with rboot and LCM using bootmode over UART.
Then LCM must be reset by pressing button (GPIO0) AFTER power cycling, and WiFi
must be configured to join your WiFi access point, and LCM to download main.bin
from github <your_login>/<your_release_repo>. See LCM project for details.


Initial planned hardware setup:
==============================

Sonoff              Dimmer
--------------------------
GND          <-->   GND
VCC          <-->   VCC
RX (GPIO 3)  <---   SIG

Operation:
==========
SIG will be driven high by the PIR sensor when it detects motion. If not motion is
detected it will be driven low after a few seconds.


Current software design:
========================

Implements HomeKit:
- Occupancy Sensor
- Switch

A GPIO interrupt handler runs on each edge on GPIO3 (RX). The PIR state is 
reflected directly in the HomeKit occupancy state.

The switch is switched on if the PIR signal goes high.
An absence timer is started if the PIR signal goes low.
After timeout, the switch is turned off again.

Button Use:
===========
Press button in first few seconds after power cycle to request OTA update.

Press the button:
- for 100 ms to toggle switch.
- for 2 seconds (LED will blink 2x2 times) then release to request OTA update.
- for 5 seconds (LED will blink 3x2 times) then release to reset the HomeKit pairing.
- for 5 seconds (LED will blink 3x2 times) then release WiFi+HomeKit settings.
